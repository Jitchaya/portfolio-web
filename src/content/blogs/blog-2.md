## Bridging Design and Development

One of the most common pain points in product teams is the handoff between design and engineering. Over the years, I've refined a workflow that minimizes friction and maximizes fidelity.

### Step 1: Design with Code in Mind

When I design in Figma, I use auto-layout, consistent spacing tokens, and naming conventions that map directly to CSS utilities. This makes the translation to Tailwind CSS almost seamless.

### Step 2: Component Mapping

Before writing any code, I map each Figma component to its frontend counterpart. This helps me identify reusable pieces and avoid duplication.

### Step 3: Build Incrementally

I start with the layout shell, then layer in components from the inside out. Each component is built in isolation first, then composed into full pages.

### Key Takeaways

- Design with development constraints in mind
- Name layers and components consistently
- Use a shared token system between Figma and code
- Review in the browser early and often
